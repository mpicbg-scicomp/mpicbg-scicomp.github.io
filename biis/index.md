## Image Analysis Services

<img src="./BIIS_workflow.png" width="100%">
 
* Image Preparation
  * Registration
  * Deconvolution
  * bleaching / bleed-through correction
  
  
* Object definition
  * Detection and segmentation
  * Define regions, points and lines that represent biological objects


* Characterization
  * object measures are used to test hypothesis and assess the model characterizing a particular biological phenomena

* Interaction, Visualisation, Automation
  * throughout the different analysis steps above users need to input information and assess analysis results
  * we provide tools to make this analysis more streamlined and reproducible

## Service types
* We provide a walk-in service for short questions or projects here we can demonstrate tools of interest and provide direct, almost instantaneous help
* For more complex projects, planned consulting sessions allow us to discuss project specifics in more detail in order to  designing a custom analysis pipeline
* This can lead to the development of custom scripts and plugins that automate analysis tasks in the proposed pipeline.
* Besides direct support the service also provides image analysis courses to raise awareness about specific tools and their usage

## Software supported
* Fiji/ImageJ
* Imaris
* Matlab
* Huygens
* Cell profilier
* Illastik
* Knime
* R/Rstudio
